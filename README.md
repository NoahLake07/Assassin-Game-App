# Assassin-Game-App
This application assists moderators with managing an ASSASSIN game. In large scale games, it can get difficult 
to moderate a game, so this application automates most of the processes and lets the moderator have full access 
to all the data for every player.

This application uses a java-based user interface and utilizes a node-like data structure within every player object 
that is created.

- Allows the moderator to setup games with an unlimited amount of players
- The application allows for a quick search of the whole player directory to pull up their information and modify it.
- The application has the ability to randomly assign all players with their targets, while keeping track of it all. The moderator 
still has the authority to modify the randomly assigned targets
- Allows the moderator to send messages to each player at once, updating them with their current targets, stats, and game updates.
- Every time a change is made (automatically and manually), it is logged to the game file and is displayed in the notification tab.
